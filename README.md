### Software Security {#CS-305-T4191}

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client for this project is a financial consulting institution named Artemis financial they wanted to modernize their software security systems and implement state-of-the-art security practices. To accomplish this a vulnerability assessment is needed to evaluate their current security vulnerabilities.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

One aspect of the security assessment that I perform thought I performed well was that the vulnerabilities check, which is a documented all the known vulnerabilities associated with the software versions that are implemented on the system. After this process I also manually inspected the code source for any underlying errors or vulnerabilities that didn't get caught in the report. This is fairly important because it secures the code base from outside attackers that may perform injection attacks or other types of hacks.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One aspect of this project that I found particularly difficult was the implementation of the rest server and making sure it was properly secure, getting the functionality correct was difficult let alone making sure it was secure.


## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

 The main way that I insured my code to be secure was by refactoring their code in the appropriate manner and changing all the instances that would have left the program vulnerable to injection attacks, as well as making sure all the appropriate packages were updated to the most recent versions.


## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After the code was refactored, I ran another dependency check to make sure everything was still up to date. 

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

One tool that I found useful was the maven dependency checker I thought this was a neat tool and since I do a lot of Java programming I’m sure I’ll revisit this tool in my future computer science endeavors.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

One thing that I would show my future employers from this assignment would be how accurate and concise the final report that I gave was, I made sure to list all the errors that I located and corrected and how those corrections were implemented and how they will make the software more secure.
